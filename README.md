This one was a lot more challenging than I thought.

Part of the problem was that i forgot I could console log the input array back to codewars to see what part of the test was breaking it, so I spent a lot of time chasing down the wrong problem (I thought it was an empty input array).  This code will sometimes pass all of the tests and sometimes not, which is a weird problem.  I didn't spend enough time chasing it down, but I think there is an issue with arrays containing 0.  The instructions didn't say whether to treat them as even or what to do about them.
